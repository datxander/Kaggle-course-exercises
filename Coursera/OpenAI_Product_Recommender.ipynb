Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop AttachmentThe Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & PrimerBEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop AttachmentThe Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & PrimerBEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop AttachmentThe Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & PrimerBEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.
